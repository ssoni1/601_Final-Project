Project Overview
In this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project, we delve into the realms of global health and economics, aiming to uncover meaningful insights by combining three essential datasets: Female Infant Mortality, Female Expectancy at Birth, and GDP per Capita. Our primary objective is to explore the potential relationships between these key indicators and gain a deeper understanding of their implications on a country's well-being.

Why This Project Matters
By examining the intersection of female infant mortality, female life expectancy at birth, and GDP per capita, we can gain valuable insights into the social and economic well-being of different countries. These indicators are crucial measures that reflect the quality of life and the level of development in a nation. Understanding their correlations can assist policymakers, researchers, and social advocates in formulating targeted strategies to improve public health, gender equality, and economic prosperity.
